# Heart Attack Predictor ðŸ«€ ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the Heart Attack Prediction repository! This project predicts the likelihood of a patient having a heart attack based on their symptoms using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model architecture.

## Overview

The repository contains:

- Python Scripts: Python scripts for training the DNN model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.
- Model: trained DNN model for the classification of having heart-attack or not.. 
- Requirements.txt: List of dependencies to install the required packages.

## Demo
